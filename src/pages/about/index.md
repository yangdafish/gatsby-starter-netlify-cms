### NO Individual Information Is Shared

There is literally zero individually identifying information shared with anyone or any government entity. That means no one can find any more information about another single person from this census.

### Actually Required By Law

Besides all the benefits we mentioned from taking the census, there is the small matter of the fact that it is actually required by law.

### The Government Site is Still the Best Source

We try to be as informative as possible on this site, but the wikipedia of census information is still the government website. 

https://www.census.gov
